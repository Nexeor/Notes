## Chapter 8: Research
When preparing for an informational interview there are two types of prep:
- **External Prep:** Information about the company/person you are interviewing with
- **Internal Prep:** Preparing answers to questions that are likely to be asked towards you
### External Preparation
The three most important external prep references are:
- Investor relations pages
	- Annual reports and 10-K forms: CEO "state of the union"
	- Quarterly results calls discuss SWOT: Strengths, Weaknesses, Oppurtunities, Threats
- Headlines on employer websites
	- Websites feature things the company is proud of 
- Top google results for employer headlines (and the interviewer themselves)
	- Google : "x company trends"
	- Negative headlines can indicate what challenges the company is facing
	- For interviewer, lets you find more about their activities for small talk, media appearances, etc.
		- Also review their linked-in page to be familiar with their background

To not sound like a stalker, only mention information you found on:
- LinkedIn profile
- Biographical info on employer's website
- Professional media appearances

**DON'T** mention:
- Nonprofessional media appearances (marriage announcements, charity activity, etc.)
- Info from personal social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)
- Anything negative

However, if you learn about something that can be used as an icebreaker, you can gently broach that topic and see if the contact wants to discuss it. If yes, use it to establish rapport, but avoid if they avoid it.
### Internal Preparation
While you will be asking the questions most of the time, there are the **Big Four** questions that you should be prepared to answer:
1) Tell me about yourself
2) Why do you want to work for our organization?
3) Why do you want to work in this role?
4) Why do you want to work in this industry?
#### Tell Me About Yourself
This is the most likely question to get asked, so have an answer prepared. Your goal is to **explain your path to this company** in a logical way that makes sense to the contact. The best way to do this is to focus on **transitions**, specifically when you moved between major life phases and why.
- **2 minutes**: MAX duration for answering this question

**FIT**: **F**avorite part, **I**nsight, **T**ransition
- Use a series of these statements to explain your lifestyle
- **Favorite Part**: Why did you enjoy from this phase?
- **Insight**: What did you learn about yourself/industry from this phase?
- **Transition**: Why did you move on from this to another phase?

Ex: My college capstone course was in Systems and Networking. My favorite part of this course was working on a large, complex codebase with many interlocking systems (F). I wanted to apply this new system level knowledge to higher level languages (I), so upon graduation I decided to transition to a more full stack role rather than focusing purely on operating systems (T).
### The Other Three Questions
The other three questions are tough, because you will want to mold your answer to match the attitude of the organization. An informational interview is designed to better equip you to answer these questions, but sometimes you have to answer them blind. 

**REC:** **R**eason, **E**vidence, **C**onnection
- **Reason**: The core of your answer
- **Evidence**: Supporting info that shows your reasoning is valid
- **Connection**: Why the employer should care

Ex: Why do you want to work as a software engineer?
Reason: Since I've been a kid I've always had a love for computers. My parents weren't big on video games, so I spent a lot of time tinkering with the family computer. I was always trying to learn how to make video games, and even went to a few summer camps for it. This eventually developed into an interest in programming, where as a sophomore in High School I developed a simple password cracking algorithm for a science fair project. This taught me how programming can be used for much more than games and developed into a natural curiosity that drives me to solve these problems. The next year I signed up for AP computer science and I haven't looked back since. 
## Chapter 9: Discussion
### Step 1: Small Talk (5-10 min)
It's important to build rapport before attempting to extract value. The three questions you should (almost) always ask are:
- How is your day going so far?
	- Temperature check question, is the contact looking to chat or all business?
- So what's been your path joining x organization?
	- This is us asking them the "tell us about yourself" question
	- Use the length and content of their answer as an example for yourself when answering their questions 
- What are you working on right now?
	- Good transition to more professional topics/questions
	- Not always necessary if first two questions got good answers
### Step 2: Q&A
Once we establish rapport, we will ask them a few questions to gain insight and continue building rapport. We will first ask questions that will establish the contact as a field expert, and then ask questions that frame them as a mentor. We will ask, in order, TIARA questions:
- Trends: Acts as an opening question to get them to talk about industry more generally but also thoughtfully 
	- “What trend is most impacting your business right now?” 
	- “How has your sector changed most since you started?” 
	- “How do you predict your industry will change most dramatically in the next several years?”
- Insights: Move the questions to be more personal and transition into advice type questions
	- “What surprises you most about your job/your employer?” 
	- “What’s the best lesson you’ve learned thus far on the job?” 
	- “What’s been your best professional decision so far, and why?” 
	- “If you had to attribute your ten years of success at your employer to one skill or trait, what would it be?” (This is especially effective for more senior or recently promoted contacts, with a good follow-up being, “Is that trait shared by many across the firm, or is it unique and you’ve adapted it to your advantage?”)
- Advice: Get the contact to see the situation from your POV and see themselves as a mentor
	- “If you were me, what’s the one thing you’d be doing now to best prepare for a career in this field?” 
	- “What do you know now that you wish you knew when you were in my position?” 
	- “If you were me, what would you be doing right now to maximize your chance of breaking into this industry or function?” 
	- “If you had just been hired into this role, what’s the most important thing you’d do in your first thirty days to ensure you got off to the fastest start possible?”
- Resources (**PIVOT QUESTION**): Get the contact to think about ways they can help you 
	- Purposefully vague! We want the contact to *offer* their contacts, not feel obliged to give them
		- Offer you a contact -> Skip to closing
		- What sort of help do you mean? -> Deflect and ask about nonreferral resources
			- “Are there any annual conferences/industry websites/LinkedIn Groups pertaining to your work that you find particularly helpful?”
			- ““What’s the most important ten minutes of research you do each week to stay current on your space?”
	- “What resources would you recommend I look into next?” 
	- “What next steps would you recommend for someone in my situation?”
- Assignments: See where you might fit in at the company
	- “Which project of yours do you feel has had the greatest impact?” 
	- “Has any particular type of project increased in popularity recently at your organization?” (If seeking internships or contract work) 
	- “Have you used interns or contractors in the past? If so, what sorts of projects have they done?

Closing: Thank them for their time and tell them you'll reach out in a week for next steps

*Ex: Our time is up, but thank you so much for your time today. You’ve given me a lot to think about. I’m going to take the weekend to reflect on all you’ve shared, but if I have any additional questions, is it okay if I reach back out to you?*
