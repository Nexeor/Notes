Hello my fellow Hunters! Monster Hunter Wilds is a complex game, with lots of moving pieces. With a game this deep it can 
## Set Building:
### 1) Preview Shows Skills
- You can hit the "preview" button to see what armor would look like on your character 
- Uses the colors selected in your layered armor
- Can see the skills of the previewed armor as if it was equipped, allowing you to "scaffold" builds
- After previewing your items, you can wishlist them!
### 2) Wishlist
- The Wishlist is a returning feature from past monster hunter games
- It allows you to track the items you want to craft 
- Whenever you pick up a crafting material you're missing for an item, you'll get a notification
- Can also open up the Wishlist menu to see your progress on every item
### 3) Large Monster Field Guide
- Can see the rarity of certain parts, and whether you have to break certain parts to get them
- Can also see a monsters weaknesses and vulnerabilities
### 4) Loadouts
- Once your set is complete, you can make it into a "loadout" to quickly swap between
- Lets you have different sets for different weapons, purposes, elements, etc. 
## Navigating the Environment
### 5) Pop-Up Camp Center
- Going to the resource center allows you to manage your Pop-Up camps across all regions
- Can move them around, set them up, repair them, etc.
- Can also customize pop-up camps appearance and add accessories 
### 6) Environment Map
- Opening the "environment map" lets you quickly see what monsters are in the area and their relative strength. 
- Can see how long a monster will stay in the area and post quests to hunt them 
	- Running up and hitting them will also start a quest to hunt them
- Pressing left on the D-Pad opens up a "quick-select" menu
	- Can quickly select which camp to fast travel to
	- You can look for specific endemic life and resources and even filter what icons can appear on the map
## Preparing for Hunts
### 7) Customizable Item Pouch
- Item pouch can be heavily customized
	- Sort button automatically moves around items
- Using "rearrange" we can stack items on top of each-other to better organize
	- Doesn't actually stack the items in bar, but can press select to quickly view pouch and switch items
- Can also "hide" essential items that you don't use much
- Create loadouts to quickly switch between item sets
	- "General" loadout for hunting anything
	- Loadouts for specific monsters
	- Loadouts for specific areas
- Can set autocrafting to on/off in the crafting menu
### 8) Customizable Radial Menu
- When you first pull it up will give you the "function" menu version. Press on the right stick to open the typical "radial" menu
	- Changing one will change the other, so should probably pick which controls scheme you prefer 
- Get access to eight different "loadouts", each loadout can hold 12 different "actions"
	- Actions can be consumables, ammo, essential items, crafting menus, communication, and even some special options
	- Hold X to rearrange loadout, press x to move around individual actions
	- Can also save each loadout and switch them out as you please
- I use four main loadouts:
	- Hunting Items
	- Essential Items
	- Slinger Ammo
	- Communication
	- (special): Ammo/Coating loadout for bowguns
- Using the 4 d-pad directions will yield intuitive selection controls but more than 4 might take some getting used to
## Cleaning Up the UI
### 9) Customizable Select Menu
- Pressing select brings up the games menus, but we can heavily customize what appears here
- Press "sub-menu" to customize what options appear:
	- Edit tabs to change the order tabs appear in and hide unwanted tabs
	- Edit favorites lets you populate your own "favorites" tab with a combination of the other options
	- Edit widgets lets to choose whether link party or gear appears on the right side of the screen
- Make favorites your first tab and fill it with your most used options to make hunting more convenient
### 10) Customizable HUD
