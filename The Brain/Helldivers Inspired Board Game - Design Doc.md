**Concept:** Cooperative tactical squad game where you use cardplay and action economy to kill hordes of enemies while accomplishing objectives. 

**Turn Structure**:
**PHASE 1: STANCE**
Before taking actions, each player picks a *stance* for this turn. This may be done simultaneously. 

Stance determines your movement and energy for the turn, and may provide an additional effect: 
- **Sprint**: high movement, medium energy
- **Aim**: medium movement, high energy
- **Reload**: low movement, low energy, *special*: return all cards in "ready" pile to hand
- **Loot**: low movement, low energy, *special*: draw card from loot deck

**PHASE 2: SPENDING MOVEMENT AND ENERGY**
During this phase players will spend their energy to play cards and their movement to traverse the map. The players may choose the order in which they take their turns.

**Movement**:
Movement is spent to move across the map. A player can spend one movement to move to an adjacent hex. 

**Energy**: 
Energy is spent to play cards from your hand
- After resolving the card, place it in its corresponding "respawn" pile above your playmat

**PHASE 3: RECHARGE**
Move all cards down one recharge pile, stopping at the "ready" pile
- Four recharge piles: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> Ready

ENEMY TURN:
**1) Movement**: Each bug moves towards the closest marine
**2) Attack:** Each bug attacks the closest marine and does damage
**3) Spawn:** Draw a spawn card and resolve it
