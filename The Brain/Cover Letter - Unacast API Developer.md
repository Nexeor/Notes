Dear Hiring Team at Unacast,

I am thrilled to apply for the API Developer position at Unacast. Unacast's mission to revolutionize location-based insights through innovative APIs aligns perfectly with my passion for leveraging technology to solve complex problems and deliver meaningful solutions. As a recent graduate in Computer Science from Virginia Tech with hands-on experience in API development and data processing, I am eager to contribute to Unacast’s cutting-edge projects.

During my time at Virginia Tech, I collaborated on several impactful projects that honed my technical and collaborative skills. For a stock trading web application, I developed dynamic user interfaces using React and integrated robust backend services via a Flask API, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend. In another project focused on virtual memory management, I implemented a supplemental page table and custom eviction policies, enhancing system performance and supporting concurrency for up to ten user programs. Additionally, I extended the PINTOS micro-OS with multi-threading capabilities and implemented thirteen system calls to improve file I/O and process lifecycle management.

These experiences deepened my expertise in Python, Flask, and React, while reinforcing my commitment to creating efficient and user-friendly solutions. Additionally, my familiarity with REST API principles and SQL database design positions me to contribute effectively to Unacast’s API ecosystem.

I am confident that my technical foundation, problem-solving skills, and enthusiasm for learning align well with this role. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work closely with experienced developers and to grow my expertise in a forward-thinking environment like Unacast.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your team’s goals. I am available at (703) 909-8704 or trjjinva@gmail.com. I'm looking forward to contributing to Unacast’s mission.

Warm regards,

Timothy Anderson
