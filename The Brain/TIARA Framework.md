- What’s the most important ten minutes of research you do each day to stay on top of trends impacting your business?

### Phase 3: Closing
**IF WE DID GET A CONTACT:** Thank them for their time and tell them that you will get in contact

**OTHERWISE**: Two part informational closing
- **Part 1:** Thank them for their time and reiterate some of the advice they gave
- **Part 2:** I'm going to take a few days to process this information. If I see any positions that are a good mutual fit, can I reach back out to you for recommendations about how to proceed?
