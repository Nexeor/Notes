# Commander Cube
### Drafting and Deckbuilding
- Packs are composed of 20 cards, with 18 nonlegends and 2 legends
- Players pick two cards at a time 
- Must build a 60 card deck adhering to commander color identity
- All mono-colored legends have partner
- Any player may choose to play the [Prismatic Pipers](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/1/the-prismatic-piper) as their commander
### Calculations
- A players deck will contain 25 lands and 35 non-lands
- A player will draft 60 cards 
- A player will use 35/60 = 58.3% of their drafted cards
- 18 non-legends * 4 players * 3 packs = 216 nonlegends drafted
- For 2/3 of cards to be drafted, 216 + 0.66 = 324 nonlegendary cards
