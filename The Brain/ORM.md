# ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
ORM is a programming technique that maps relational database tables to OOP classes
- We don't write any SQL, we simply request data and the ORM handles it
- Decouples the database from our code

### Data Models
**Data Models** are the template that determine how the table corresponds to the class
- Maps the columns to the class variables
