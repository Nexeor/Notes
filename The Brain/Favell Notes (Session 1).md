Dwarf being publicly shamed for stealing from multiple businesses 
- Notably didn't steal from the fishermen
- Ended up freeing him (guards don't know where he is?)

Homack - Bartender
- Believes the dwarf isn't responsible for the crimes
	- The dwarf was the sheriff many years ago
- Checking out backroom for him for access to festival
	- His whiskey got stolen and wants us to find him

Checked out the backroom
- Found a tunnel inside a baseboard 
- Tunnel was trapped when we went inside
- Later part of tunnel was sealed off by invisible wall

Bim harassed Stinky Steve
- Half elf woman by the docks (beautiful, blonde) 
- Was planning to ask her out

Half Elf Woman:
- Selling "Elven Necklaces" (fake, stolen from docks)
- Kezro interrogated her and got one of the necklaces 
- Magic of the necklace was similar to the magic of the invisible wall in the backroom, and "attached" to the invisible wall
	- Opened slightly and we saw an image inside of an unrecognizable person 

Went outside to find a amulet shop on fire and pillaged
- Took the shelf (on fire) outside the shop
- Met Roderick, the owner, who knew more about the amulet

We went back to the tunnel with Roderick, but found it collapsed with the name "Bran Vruk Eggus" etched onto it with the message "Proceed No Further"

New Marshall loves the whiskey? (suspicious...)

Went down to the docks to check out the Sandwich shop
- Met the downtrodden sub shop employee, Jeff
- Guards met us there and escorted us to the Marshall's office
	- Gossip about the Dwarf is that he is being used as a scapegoat

Travelled to the Marshall's office, which was quite ornate with many sets of armor standing around
- Marshall is a taller human, walks strangely, and is always seen gripping onto someone
- Accused Roderick of committing insurance fraud
- Bim tackled the sheriff and revealed that he was in fact three kobolds in a trench coat
	- The Kobolds reveal themselves to be Bran, Vruk, and Eggus
	- More Kobolds poured out of a backroom and the armor activated to attack us
