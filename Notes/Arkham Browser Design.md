Three different categories of cards:
- Investigators 
- Cards that go in player decks (player cards, weaknesses)
- Scenario cards (Enemies, locations, agendas, etc.)

Each category of cards has distinct properties, so the user must pick between searching each one
- We can have an "all" option, but its search capabilities will be more restricted
	- This can allow browsing "by set"
- Radio menu at top allows user to pick category
- Category filters the results, but only a "new search" triggers an API request
